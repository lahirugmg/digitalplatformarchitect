# Platform Observability: From Metrics to Insights

Modern platform architectures generate vast amounts of operational data. The challenge isn't collecting this dataâ€”it's transforming it into actionable insights that drive better decisions and outcomes.

## The Three Pillars of Observability

### Metrics
Quantitative measurements that provide high-level system health indicators.

### Logs
Detailed records of discrete events within your system.

### Traces
Request flow tracking across distributed system boundaries.

## Beyond the Three Pillars

### Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
Define and measure what matters to your users, not just what's easy to monitor.

### Business Metrics
Connect technical metrics to business outcomes and user experience.

## Implementation Strategy

Start with user-centric SLOs and work backward to the supporting telemetry data you need to collect and analyze.

## Tools and Technologies

- **OpenTelemetry** for standardized instrumentation
- **Prometheus** for metrics collection
- **Jaeger** for distributed tracing
- **ELK Stack** for log management

## Best Practices

1. Monitor the user experience, not just system resources
2. Use SLOs to define and measure reliability
3. Implement progressive alerting based on error budgets
4. Create runbooks for common scenarios

## Conclusion

Effective observability transforms raw operational data into strategic insights that improve both system reliability and business outcomes.
