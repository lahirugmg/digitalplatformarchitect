Designing a role-based, AI-assisted learning journey for digital enterprise platform architecture is a fantastic way to ensure everyone—from the CEO to the SRE—understands the system design without getting overwhelmed or bogged down by the wrong level of detail.

Here is a comprehensive framework to map out this flow, expanding on your categories, adding new goals, and defining the next actionable decisions in an AI-assisted journey.

Phase 1: Context Setting ("I'M A...")
Your categories are spot on. Let's flesh them out to ensure all critical stakeholders are represented in the platform lifecycle.

BUSINESS & STRATEGY (Non-Technical to Semi-Technical)

Executive / CEO / Advisor

Business Stakeholder / Sponsor

Product Manager

UX/UI Designer

ARCHITECTURE & ANALYSIS (Semi-Technical to High-Technical)

Business Analyst

Enterprise Architect

Solution Architect (Responsible for system design, patterns, and standards)

Security Architect

Data Architect

ENGINEERING & OPERATIONS (High-Technical)

Principal Engineer / Implementation Lead

Software Developer

Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) / DevOps

QA Engineer / Test Automation Lead

Phase 2: Goal Selection ("I WANT TO...")
You have a solid foundation. Depending on the role selected in Phase 1, the platform should surface the most relevant goals. Here is the expanded list of what stakeholders typically want to achieve:

Strategy & Value: * Understand the business architecture and capability map.

Assess the build vs. buy (or SaaS vs. custom) trade-offs.

Understand the cost model and return on investment (ROI).

Design & Structure:

Understand the solution architecture and component interactions.

Understand the data architecture, data flow, and governance.

Review API and integration strategies.

Security & Risk:

Understand the security architecture, IAM, and threat models.

Review compliance, data residency, and risk management.

Infrastructure & Operations:

Understand the deployment architecture and cloud infrastructure.

Understand how to design observability (metrics, logs, traces) for the platform.

Plan for disaster recovery (DR) and high availability.

Phase 3: The AI-Assisted Journey & Next Decisions
Once the user selects their Role and Goal, the AI should tailor the output to their technical depth. Here is how that journey looks and the decisions it empowers them to make:

1. The Executive / Business Stakeholder Journey

Goal Selected: "Understand the business architecture" or "Assess ROI."

The AI Assist: The AI generates a high-level executive summary, focusing on business capabilities, time-to-market, and cost implications. It avoids technical jargon, using analogies and translating system design choices into business impact.

Next Decision to Make:

Approve or reject budget allocations.

Prioritize features for the next quarter.

Align the platform strategy with broader company OKRs.

2. The Product Manager / Business Analyst Journey

Goal Selected: "Understand the solution architecture" or "Review API integration."

The AI Assist: The AI provides functional diagrams (like context or container diagrams) and user flow maps. It highlights how the user journeys map to specific microservices or platform capabilities and points out potential bottlenecks or dependencies.

Next Decision to Make:

Finalize the product roadmap based on technical dependencies.

Write or refine user stories and acceptance criteria.

Identify functional gaps between business requirements and the proposed architecture.

3. The Architect Journey (Enterprise, Solution, Security)

Goal Selected: "Understand solution architecture" or "Understand security architecture."

The AI Assist: The AI dives deep. It generates dynamic architectural diagrams (e.g., sequence, component, or deployment diagrams), highlights design patterns (like event-driven or CQRS), and flags potential architectural anti-patterns. It can simulate load or security threats.

Next Decision to Make:

Approve the final technology stack and tooling.

Define the enterprise standards and guardrails.

Sign off on the security and compliance posture.

4. The Engineering & Operations Journey (Dev, SRE, QA)

Goal Selected: "Understand deployment architecture" or "Design observability."

The AI Assist: The AI provides granular, actionable artifacts. For a developer, it might generate API contracts or boilerplate code matching the architecture. For an SRE, it provides infrastructure-as-code snippets, network topology maps, and recommended alerts for Prometheus/Grafana dashboards.

Next Decision to Make:

Begin implementation and define sprint tasks.

Configure the CI/CD pipelines and deployment strategies (e.g., blue-green, canary).

Establish the exact metrics, SLIs, and SLOs to monitor.
