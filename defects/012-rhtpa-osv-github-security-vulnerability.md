# Defect: Security Vulnerability in rhtpa/osv-github Package

## Defect ID
012

## Severity
**MEDIUM**

## Status
Open

## Component
Dependencies - Package Vulnerability

## Description
A known security vulnerability has been identified in the `rhtpa(osv-github)` package. The package contains 1 known security vulnerability with a MEDIUM severity rating.

## Vulnerability Details
- **Package**: rhtpa (osv-github)
- **Known Vulnerabilities**: 1
- **Highest Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Source**: OSV (Open Source Vulnerabilities) via GitHub

## Impact
This medium-severity vulnerability in a project dependency may impact:
- Application security posture
- Deployment compliance
- Potential runtime exploitation risks

## Root Cause
The `rhtpa` package dependency (or its transitive dependencies) contains an identified vulnerability that needs to be addressed through:
- Package update to patched version
- Dependency tree review
- Security audit of package usage

## Reproduction Steps
1. Check package.json for rhtpa dependency
2. Run vulnerability scan (npm audit or similar)
3. Cross-reference with OSV database
4. Review dependency tree for indirect dependencies

## Investigation Required
- [ ] Identify exact vulnerability CVE/OSV ID
- [ ] Determine if rhtpa is direct or transitive dependency
- [ ] Check if patched version exists
- [ ] Assess if vulnerability affects current code usage
- [ ] Priority: Can we update without breaking changes?

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Vulnerability resolved by updating package to patched version
- [ ] npm audit shows no vulnerabilities for rhtpa
- [ ] All tests pass after dependency update
- [ ] No breaking changes introduced
- [ ] Build completes successfully

## Related Tasks
- Review all direct dependencies for security vulns
- Implement automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
- Establish dependency update policy

## Notes
- This should be addressed before next production deployment
- Check if the package is actually used in production code
- Consider alternatives if updates are not available
- Document any workarounds if update is not possible
