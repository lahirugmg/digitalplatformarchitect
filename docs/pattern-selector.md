# Architecture Pattern Selector

The Architecture Pattern Selector is an interactive tool that helps users choose suitable architectural patterns based on their business needs and technical constraints. It provides personalized recommendations across six key platform pillars.

## Features

### Interactive Questionnaire
- 10 carefully crafted questions covering different aspects of system requirements
- Questions organized by platform pillars: API Management, Integration, IAM, Message Broker, Services, and Data Platform
- Support for both single-choice and multiple-choice answers
- "I'm not sure" options to avoid dead-ends
- Progress indicator and navigation controls

### Intelligent Scoring Algorithm
- Pattern scores calculated based on user responses
- Pillar-specific sub-scores for detailed recommendations
- Top 3 pattern recommendations with transparent rationale
- Weighted scoring system that considers trade-offs between patterns

### Six Platform Pillars
Each result provides actionable guidance across six key areas:

1. **API Management** - Rate limiting, security, analytics, versioning, developer portals
2. **Enterprise Integration** - Synchronous APIs, messaging, event streaming, legacy integration  
3. **IAM** - Authentication, authorization, zero-trust, compliance, audit logging
4. **Message Broker** - Request-response, pub-sub, event sourcing, streaming, queuing
5. **Microservices & Domain Services** - Service scale, team structure, deployment patterns
6. **Data Platform** - Consistency models, data volume, processing patterns

### Deep Linking
- Direct links to relevant Building Blocks pages (`/blocks/[slug]`)
- Links to applicable Blueprints (`/blueprints/[slug]`) 
- External links open in new tabs for seamless exploration

### State Management & Sharing
- URL-encoded state for shareable permalinks
- LocalStorage persistence for session continuity
- Query parameter format: `?answers=[encoded-json]`

### Export & Documentation
- Markdown export functionality for offline documentation
- Print-friendly PDF generation via browser print
- Comprehensive reports including pattern descriptions and pillar recommendations

## Supported Patterns

The tool evaluates 14 architectural patterns:

- **Microservice Architecture** - Independently deployable services
- **Modular Monolith** - Single deployment with internal modularity
- **Event-Driven Architecture** - Loosely coupled via events
- **Layered Architecture** - Traditional multi-tier separation
- **Hexagonal Architecture** - Ports and adapters pattern
- **Service-Oriented Architecture** - Standardized service interfaces
- **CQRS** - Command Query Responsibility Segregation
- **Serverless Architecture** - Function-as-a-Service model
- **Cell-Based Architecture** - Self-contained units with gateways
- **Data Mesh** - Decentralized data architecture
- **OAuth2 Architecture** - Secure authorization framework
- **Zero Trust Architecture** - Continuous verification security
- **Event Sourcing** - State as event sequence
- **Adapter Pattern** - Legacy integration wrapper

## Question Categories

### System Scale & Team Structure
- Expected service count and team size
- Development team organization
- Deployment complexity preferences

### Technical Requirements
- Performance and scalability needs
- Data consistency requirements
- Security and compliance mandates

### Integration Patterns
- API management requirements
- Messaging and communication needs
- Data processing and storage patterns

## Implementation Details

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: CSS custom properties (consistent with site theme)
- **Data**: JSON-based question bank and pattern catalog
- **State**: URL parameters + localStorage
- **Build**: Next.js static generation

### Data Structure
```typescript
{
  questions: Question[],
  patterns: Record<string, PatternInfo>,
  pillarMappings: Record<PillarId, MappingInfo>
}
```

### Scoring Algorithm
1. Initialize all pattern scores to 0
2. For each user answer:
   - Look up pattern weights in question option
   - Add weights to pattern total and pillar-specific scores
3. Sort patterns by total score (descending)
4. Return top 3 with pillar breakdowns

### Accessibility Features
- Keyboard navigation support
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- High contrast ratios (WCAG 2.2 AA)
- Progressive enhancement (works without JavaScript for basic navigation)

## Usage Analytics

The tool tracks the following events:
- `view_results` - User completes questionnaire
- `open_api_mgmt_link` - Click on API Management recommendations
- `open_integration_link` - Click on Integration recommendations  
- `open_iam_link` - Click on IAM recommendations
- `open_message_broker_link` - Click on Message Broker recommendations
- `open_services_link` - Click on Services recommendations
- `open_data_platform_link` - Click on Data Platform recommendations
- `export_summary` - Export results to Markdown

```

## Development

### Adding New Questions
1. Add question object to `data/questions.json`
2. Include pattern scoring weights in each option
3. Assign to appropriate pillar for result categorization

### Adding New Patterns
1. Add pattern to `patterns` object in JSON
2. Include name, description, and slug
3. Update question options to include scoring for new pattern
4. Verify pattern slug matches existing pattern pages

### Modifying Pillar Mappings
Update `pillarMappings` in JSON to change which building blocks and blueprints are recommended for each pillar.

## Testing

The tool includes comprehensive manual testing coverage:
- Complete questionnaire flow (intro → questions → results)
