# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Solar
**Date:** 2026-02-23

## Session Overview

**Topic:** UX improvement for sleek design with reduced color distraction
**Goals:** Generate ideas for refined visual design that maintains usability while reducing visual noise

### Session Setup

Session confirmed with focus on creating a more refined, minimalist visual experience that enhances usability. The facilitator will guide through user-selected creativity techniques to explore innovative approaches to sleek UX design with minimal color distraction.

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** User-Selected Techniques
**Selected Techniques:**

- **Analogical Thinking**: Drawing parallels from other domains (architecture, fashion, product design) that have mastered sleekness and minimal color distraction. Transfers proven patterns into UX work.
- **First Principles Thinking**: Strips away assumptions to rebuild color strategy from fundamental UX truths. Questions every assumption about why colors exist in the interface.

**Selection Rationale:** This combination provides both external inspiration from masters of minimalism (Analogical) and internal clarity from rebuilding assumptions (First Principles). Together they balance fresh external patterns with rebuilt foundational understanding.
