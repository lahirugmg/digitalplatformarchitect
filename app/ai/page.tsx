            Digital platforms connect systems, expose APIs, move data, and empower developers. A new force is reshaping how these platforms are built and how they power the next generation of applications: Artificial Intelligence (AI).

            When thinking about AI and platform architecture, there are two complementary lenses:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>AI for Code</strong> ‚Äî how AI makes it faster and smarter to design, build, and operate digital platforms.</li>
            <li><strong>Code for AI</strong> ‚Äî how platform building blocks provide the foundation for AI systems to run safely and at scale.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Let‚Äôs unpack both.</p>

          <h2>AI for Code: Smarter Platforms</h2>
          <p>
            AI isn‚Äôt just about chatbots and copilots‚Äîit‚Äôs becoming a key teammate for architects and developers. Imagine asking a natural‚Äëlanguage prompt like ‚Äúconnect SAP orders to Salesforce CRM and enrich with inventory data,‚Äù and an AI assistant generates the integration flow, tests, and error handling.
          </p>
          <h3>Examples</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Messaging & Streaming</strong>: AI suggests optimal topic partitions or retention policies, and even generates stream‚Äëprocessing jobs from plain English.</li>
            <li><strong>API Management</strong>: Conversational discovery helps developers find the right APIs instantly, while AI creates client SDKs and tests.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Platforms</strong>: Natural‚Äëlanguage SQL and AI‚Äëdriven data‚Äëquality checks accelerate analytics.</li>
            <li><strong>Observability</strong>: LLMs summarize incidents, propose fixes, and draft postmortems.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Result</strong>: faster delivery, smarter operations, and better developer experience.</p>
        </section>

          <h2>Code for AI: Platforms Power AI</h2>
          <p>
            On the flip side, building reliable AI systems requires the very same building blocks of digital platforms. Think of your platform as the operating system for AI.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Messaging & Streaming</strong>: Real‚Äëtime pipelines for streaming inference and multi‚Äëagent coordination.</li>
            <li><strong>Enterprise Integration</strong>: Orchestrates system calls for AI agents, securely connecting ERP, CRM, or payment systems.</li>
            <li><strong>API Management</strong>: Publishes AI tools as APIs with policies, quotas, and security.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Platform</strong>: Powers retrieval‚Äëaugmented generation (RAG), vector stores, and feature pipelines.</li>
            <li><strong>Identity & Access Management</strong>: Enforces consent, scopes, and authentication for human and machine users.</li>
            <li><strong>Internal Developer Platform</strong>: Golden paths to deploy inference services, agents, and sandboxes quickly.</li>
            <li><strong>Observability</strong>: Monitors AI prompts, responses, costs, and quality‚Äîmaking AI not just powerful, but reliable.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In other words, the same platform layers that power digital business today are the backbone of tomorrow‚Äôs AI systems.

          <h2>Real‚ÄëWorld Scenarios</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>API Discovery with AI</strong>: A developer asks, ‚ÄúHow do I integrate payments?‚Äù An AI assistant in the API portal suggests the right API, generates a working client, and ensures security policies are enforced.</li>
            <li><strong>RAG with Governance</strong>: A data platform ingests documents with lineage and consent. The AI model retrieves context through APIs, with identity enforcing purpose limitation.</li>
            <li><strong>Multi‚ÄëAgent Workflows</strong>: Agents communicate over the event bus, invoke tools via managed APIs, and authenticate with scoped tokens.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These scenarios show AI isn‚Äôt a bolt‚Äëon‚Äîit‚Äôs woven into the fabric of platform design.

          <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
          <p>
            Companies that embrace this dual lens‚Äî<em>AI for Code</em> and <em>Code for AI</em>‚Äîwill build faster, safer, and more resilient digital platforms. They‚Äôll empower teams with AI‚Äëdriven productivity while ensuring AI workloads themselves run with governance, observability, and trust.
          </p>
          <p><strong>The message is simple:</strong></p>
          <p>üëâ Use AI to build better platforms. Use platforms to ship better AI.</p>
