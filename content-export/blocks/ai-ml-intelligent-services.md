# AI/ML & Intelligent Services Platform

## Summary
Where your data platform feeds into inference, model deployment, and continuous learning pipelines. This building block turns data into intelligence by managing ML models, embeddings, vector databases, and generative AI services.

## What it is

An intelligent services platform that transforms data into actionable intelligence through ML model lifecycle management, real-time inference, and generative AI capabilities. It bridges the gap between data platforms and business applications by providing scalable, production-ready AI services.

## Core Responsibilities

- ML model training, validation, and deployment pipelines
- Real-time and batch inference serving with auto-scaling
- Model registry and versioning with A/B testing capabilities
- Vector databases and embedding management for semantic search
- Generative AI services and LLM integration
- Continuous learning and model retraining automation

## Model Lifecycle Management

- Experiment tracking and model versioning
- Automated training pipelines with hyperparameter tuning
- Model validation and performance monitoring
- Staged deployment with canary releases and rollbacks
- Model registry with metadata and lineage tracking
- Automated retraining triggers based on data drift

## Inference & Serving

- High-performance model serving with GPU/CPU optimization
- Real-time inference APIs with sub-100ms latency
- Batch prediction processing for large datasets
- Auto-scaling based on traffic patterns and resource usage
- Multi-model serving and ensemble predictions
- Edge deployment for low-latency applications

## Vector & Embedding Services

- Vector databases for similarity search and retrieval
- Embedding generation and management pipelines
- Semantic search and recommendation engines
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementations
- Knowledge graph integration and entity linking
- Multi-modal embeddings for text, images, and audio

## Generative AI & LLM Integration

- Prompt engineering and template management
- Multi-provider LLM gateway with cost optimization
- Content generation and summarization services
- Conversational AI and chatbot frameworks
- AI safety and content moderation pipelines

## Data Integration & Feature Engineering

- Feature stores with real-time and batch feature serving
- Data pipeline integration with streaming and batch sources
- Feature engineering and transformation pipelines
- Data quality monitoring and drift detection
- Multi-source data fusion and enrichment
- Privacy-preserving ML with federated learning

## Monitoring & Observability

- Model performance monitoring and alerting
- Data drift and concept drift detection
- Inference latency and throughput monitoring

- Model audit trails and compliance reporting
- Adversarial attack detection and defense
- Bias detection and fairness monitoring
- Responsible AI governance and ethics frameworks

## Architecture Patterns

- Microservices architecture for ML model serving
- Event-driven ML pipelines with real-time triggers
- Lambda architecture for batch and stream processing
- Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) with API-first design
- Multi-cloud and hybrid ML deployment strategies
- Edge computing for distributed inference

## Tech Examples
