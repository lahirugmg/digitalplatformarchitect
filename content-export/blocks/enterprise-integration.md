- Orchestration and routing
- Operational visibility and error handling

## Core capabilities

- Connector catalog and lifecycle
- Contract-first transformations and testing
- Secrets management and policy enforcement
- Self-service integration pipelines

## Architecture patterns

- Canonical data models
- Event-driven integration
- File-based and batch with idempotency
- Edge adapters and strangler patterns

## Tech examples

- WSO2 Integrator: Ballerina Integrator
- WSO2 IPaaS solution: Devant
- MuleSoft
- Boomi
- Apache Camel
- Spring Integration
- Azure Integration Services

## KPIs/SLIs

- Success rate and MTTR for integrations
- Throughput and latency per flow
- Change lead time and failure rate
- Partner SLA adherence
