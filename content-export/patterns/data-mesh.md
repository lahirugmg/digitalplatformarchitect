# Data Mesh

## Summary
Decentralized, domain-oriented data ownership; data as a product with federated governance and platform self-service.

## What it is

A socio-technical approach applying domain-driven design to analytics: teams own data products with clear contracts, quality, and discoverability.

## Benefits

- Scales data ownership with domains
- Improves accountability and quality
- Promotes interoperability via contracts

## Trade-offs

- Requires strong governance enablement
- Investment in platform and tooling
- Risk of fragmentation without standards

## When to use

- Large orgs with many data domains
- Bottlenecked centralized data teams
- Desire for faster, domain-owned analytics
