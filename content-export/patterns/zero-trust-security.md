# Zero-Trust Security Architecture

## Summary
Never trust, always verify. Security model assuming breach and requiring verification for every access request.

## What it is

A security framework that eliminates implicit trust and requires verification for every user, device, and service attempting access, regardless of location.

## Core Principles

- Verify explicitly: Use all available data points for authentication
- Least privilege access: Limit user and service permissions to minimum required
- Assume breach: Design for containment and minimize blast radius

## Implementation Components

- Identity and Access Management with multi-factor authentication
- Network micro-segmentation and policy enforcement
- Device compliance and endpoint protection
- Real-time risk assessment and adaptive policies

## Benefits

- Reduced attack surface and lateral movement
- Improved visibility and audit trails
- Better compliance posture
- Support for remote work and cloud adoption

## When to use

- Cloud-first or hybrid infrastructure
- Regulatory compliance requirements
- Remote workforce or BYOD environments
- Legacy perimeter security proving inadequate
