# Monolithic Architecture

## Summary
Single deployable unit combining multiple modules. Simple operationally and effective for many products.

## What it is

A cohesive application packaged and deployed as one unit. Can still be well-modularized internally with clear boundaries.

## Benefits

- Operational simplicity and easier debugging
- Easier local development
- Great for small teams and early stages

## Trade-offs

- Scale and release coupling
- Risk of big-ball-of-mud without discipline
