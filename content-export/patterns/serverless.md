# Serverless

## Summary
Event-driven functions and managed services with autoscaling and pay-per-use.

## What it is

A deployment model using functions, managed databases, and event sources. Reduces ops burden but couples to provider runtime.

## Trade-offs

- Cold starts and latency variance
- Observability and local dev challenges
- Vendor lock-in considerations
