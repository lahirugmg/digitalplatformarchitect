# Master Digital Platform Architecture

Digital platform architects identify the essential technical **building blocks** and align them with the right **architectural patterns** — creating robust, scalable, future‑ready platforms. The ultimate outcome is delivering **solutions** that tackle real business challenges and generate measurable value.

## Digital Platform Building Blocks

The core capabilities that power modern enterprise platforms:

- Application & Services
- Messaging & Streaming Platform
- Enterprise Integration
- API Management
- Identity & Access Management
- Internal Developer Platform
- Data Platform
- AI/ML & Intelligent Services
- Observability & Monitoring

## Architecture Patterns

Visual guides to proven architectural approaches:

- Layered Architecture
- Microservice Architecture
- Cell-Based Architecture
- Event-Driven Architecture
- N-Tier (Client-Server) Architecture
- Microkernel / Plugin Architecture
- Hexagonal Architecture
- And many more...

## Architecture Journey
